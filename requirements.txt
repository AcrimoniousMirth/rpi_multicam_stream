# Note: These are installed via apt (system packages) by install.sh
# to avoid issues with externally-managed Python environments.
#
# Installation command in install.sh:
# sudo apt-get install -y python3-yaml
#
# If you need to install manually:
# - Debian/Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi OS: sudo apt install python3-yaml
# - Or use a virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install PyYAML
